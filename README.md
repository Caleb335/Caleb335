### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caleb.

I'm a Frontend Developer and writer, I literally just implement/transform the designs of user interfaces to things that are alive on the web. 

Cheers! :cocktail:

- I make use of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.com) to translate user interfaces that are aesthetic and accessible for people
- Recently started using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) too.
- Just getting familiar with the opensource software community

PS: **I and JavaScript are sworn enemies** :grin:
